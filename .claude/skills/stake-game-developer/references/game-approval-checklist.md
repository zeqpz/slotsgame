# Game Approval Checklist

Reference checklist for testing game readiness for Stake Engine.

## PreChecks

- [ ] **Restrictions**: Game is strictly stateless (no persistence between rounds).
- [ ] **Restrictions**: No Jackpots, Gamble features, or Early Cashout.
- [ ] **Restrictions**: No IP infringement or Stake branding in assets.
- [ ] Game authenticates with RGS successfully on game launch.
- [ ] Clicking on the bet button sends a successful play request to RGS.
- [ ] Game title is unique and does not contain terms such as Megaways, Xways.
- [ ] Game assets and imagery do not contain offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate content.

## Game Thumbnail

- [ ] Game tile is generally bright and does not clash with the Stake Background (avoid dark edges).
- [ ] Background image is bright and appropriate for the game.
- [ ] Foreground image is appropriate, with key focus area correctly filled.
- [ ] Gradient is a similar color to the background.
- [ ] Game title fits within inner guidelines (not too close to edges).

## Math Requirements

- [ ] **RTP**: 90% -> 98%.
- [ ] **RTP Consistency**: All modes must have an RTP within 0.5% of each other (e.g., 97% game must be 96.5% - 97.5%).
- [ ] **Max Win**: Advertised max-win is achievable (hit-rate 1 in 20,000,000 or more frequent).
- [ ] **Hit Rate**: Reasonable > 0-win hit-rate (typically 3-8, not > 20 for base).

## RGS Requirements

### Bet Levels
- [ ] Respected: USD $0.10 -> $1,000 (Defaults to $1.00).
- [ ] Respected: JPY Y10 -> Y150,000 (Defaults to Y100).
- [ ] Respected: MXN MX1 -> MX15,000 (Defaults to MX10).
- [ ] **Persistence**: Refreshing game mid-spin preserves selected bet-amount (does not revert to default).

### RGS URL
- [ ] Game uses `rgs_url` query parameter to determine which server to call.
  - *Test case:* Change RGS URL query param and ensure game calls that URL.

## Frontend Requirements

### Game Rules

- [ ] Retrigger conditions stated (e.g., 2 Scatters = +5 spins).
- [ ] **Disclaimer**: Equivalent to:
  > “Malfunction voids all pays and plays. A consistent internet connection is required. In the event of a disconnection, reload the game to finish any uncompleted bets.

### Responsive Checks
